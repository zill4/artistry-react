A powerful component library for React.  All components have been designed with React in mind, reducing re-renders and other JavaScript activity.

Furthermore, the components are designed to work seamlessly together.  They are built using a simple, powerful, and configurable stylesheet.  Most animation is style based, again reducing JavaScript activity.

The API is focused on consistency, and ease of use.
